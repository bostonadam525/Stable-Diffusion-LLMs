## 1. Image Classification
* Classify what is in an image.

### Image Classification Algorithms/Models
1. BLIP
2. ResNet
3. VGGNet

## 2. Object Detection, Recognition, & Localization
* Bounding boxes are typically used to identify and locate object(s) in an image.


### Object Detection Algorithms/Models
1. Faster R-CNN
2. YOLO v7
3. SSD


## 3. Semantic Segmentation
* The purpose is to identify each pixel within an image for a more detailed categorization.
* This method produces more precise classification by assigning a label to an objectâ€™s individual pixels.
* Each pixel in the image is classified and segmented to represent distinct objects or regions based on semantic categories.

### Semantic Segmentation Algorithms/Models
1. FastFCN
2. DeepLab
3. U-Net

## 4. Instance Segmentation
* The goal is to identify each instance of the same object, making it more specific and refined than semantic segmentation.
* As an example, if there are 3 dogs in an image, instance segmentation will separately identify and highlight each dog, identifying them as distinct instances.

### Instance Segmentation Algorithms/Models
1. SAM
2. Mask R-CNN

## 5. Image Classification with Localization
* This is a more complex version of the image classification problem as it assigns a class label to the image and also creates a bounding box around single objects in the image.

## 6. Pose Estimation
* This method will identify key semantic points of an object to track orientation.
* As an example, this will help identify human body movements by marking key points such as shoulders, right arm, left arm, etc.

### Pose Estimation Algorithms/Models
1. OpenPose
2. MoveNet
3. PoseNet

## 7. Image Generation/Stable Diffusion
* Generative AI applications commonly using LLMS and Stable Diffusion to generate images from text.
* This can also include multimodal use cases.

### Image Generation Algorithms/Models
1. Stable Diffusion
2. DALL-E
3. MidJourney


## 8. Recognition
- Pattern recognition
- Facial recognition

## 9. Edge Detection

## 10. Feature Matching
